# ## Mann Whitney U Test

# ### Objectives and characteristics of this test

# - This test is another non-parametric test that wants to confirm whether or not there are differences between the median values of two populations.
# - Scale: ordinal.
# - It is not necessary to assume normal distribution for the original variable.
# - We analyze two independent samples.
# - The unit of measurement has to be the same for both samples.
# - We do not need to assume homogeneity between the variables.

# - The alternative Hypothesis could be:  
#   - < if we want to determine if the values of one sample are less than the other one
#   - \> If we want to determine if the values of one sample are greater than the other one
#   - â‰  if we want to determine whether there are differences or not
# - This is the non=parametric version of the t-test for two populations means.
# - This is also known as the Wilcoxon sum of rank test.

# ### Constants

ALPHA = 0.05


# ### Formula

# $$
# U=Min(U_1, U_2)  \\
# z = \frac{U-m_U}{\sigma_U}  \\
# m_U = \frac{n_1n_2}{2}  \\
# \sigma_U=\sqrt{\frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}} \\
# \\
# $$

# #### All together

# $$
# z = \frac{U-\frac{n_1n_2}{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}}}
# $$

# ### function

def calculate_z_score(test_statistic, sample1_size, sample2_size):
    U1 = test_statistic
    U2 = sample1_size * sample2_size - U1
    U = min(U1, U2)
    return (U - sample1_size * sample2_size / 2) / numpy.sqrt(
        sample1_size * sample2_size * (sample1_size + sample2_size + 1) / 12)


# ## Example

# You work for a company that produces two brands of detergents: Super and Best. Before deciding the investment in advertising you need to know if there are differences in the acceptance between one and another one. The company gives a free trial to 25 people for the Super detergent and to 22 people for the detergent Best and asked them to qualify the performance from 1 to 10. You can find the results on the file "detergent-performance.csv". Try to find if one brand needs more publicity than the other one using 5% level of significance.

# #### Hypothesis Statement
# $H_0$: There is no difference in the performance of the detergents  
# $H_1$: There is a difference in the performance of the detergents  
# *For example, if you wanted to test whether Super is performing better than Best, the performance  
# should be greater, this would be your test:  
# $H_0$: There is no difference in the performance of the detergents  
# $H_1$: Super performance is greater than Best  




# ### Load file

filename = 'detergent-performance.csv'


# remote
filepath = 'https://github.com/markcrowe-com/statistics/blob/master/mann-whitney-u-test/'+ filename + '?raw=true'


# local
filepath = filename


dataframe: DataFrame = read_csv(filepath)


dataframe.head()


# ### Format Data

super_dataframe: DataFrame = dataframe[(dataframe['Detergent'] == "Super")].reset_index()
best_dataframe: DataFrame = dataframe[(dataframe['Detergent'] == "Best")].reset_index()


super_dataframe.head()


sample1 = best_dataframe['Performance']
sample2 = super_dataframe['Performance']


# ### The Math

test_statistic, p_value = mannwhitneyu(sample1, sample2)
z_score = calculate_z_score(test_statistic, len(sample1), len(sample2))

print('Test-statistic (U) = %.3f, p-value = %.3f' % (test_statistic, p_value))
print('Z-score = %.3f' % z_score)

# ### Interpretation

if p_value > ALPHA:

else:

# According to the test and at a 5% of significance level, we can say that there is no evidence to say that
# there are differences in the consumer's preferences between the brands
